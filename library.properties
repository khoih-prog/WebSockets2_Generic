sentence=A WebSocket Server and Client library for Arduino, based on RFC6455, for writing modern Websockets applications. Now support ESP8266, ESP32 (including ESP32-C3; ESP32-S2 Saola, AI-Thinker ESP-12K, etc.), nRF52, SAMD21, SAMD51, SAM DUE, STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1, Teensy, RP2040-based, etc. boards, with WiFiNINA, WiFi101, Teensy 4.1 NativeEthernet, Ethernet W5x00/ENC28J60/LAN8742A/LAN8720, ESP8266/ESP32-AT modules/shields, as well as SINRIC / Alexa / Google Home. Now with updated SSL CA Certs, Fingerprint and InSecure mode.
paragraph=Featuring modern callbacks (supports lambdas) and a minimal interface. Contains a websockets Client and Server. Supports all features of the RFC6455 (pings, pongs, binary and text data, error codes) and WSS (Websockets over SSL). Now support ESP8266, ESP32 (including ESP32-C3; ESP32-S2 Saola, AI-Thinker ESP-12K, etc.), nRF52, SAMD21, SAMD51, SAM DUE, STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1, Teensy, RP2040-based, etc. boards, with WiFiNINA, Teensy 4.1 NativeEthernet, Ethernet W5x00/ENC28J60/LAN8742A/LAN8720, ESP8266/ESP32-AT modules/shields, as well as SINRIC / Alexa / Google Home.
